# 👋 Hi, I’m 潘宇琦

Welcome to my personal website!

I’m a rising senior majoring in Software Engineering, with a focus on **frontend development**.  
My main tech stack includes **Vue**, **React**, and other modern frontend tools such as **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **Vite**.

I’m also deeply interested in the field of **product management**, and currently learning product thinking, user-centered design, and prototyping using tools like **Figma**.  
I enjoy exploring how technology and design come together to solve real-world problems, and I'm continuously growing through hands-on projects.
And here's a photo of me when I was travelling in New Zealand.
